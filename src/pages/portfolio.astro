            For Happs Development I created and maintained the <b>Angular</b>{

            }
            website for Karaton where speech therapists and parents of dyslexic could
            follow up on the progress their children/patients are making in the Karaton
            game.

            There were a lot of graphs to be shown with Highcharts, a payment
            integration through Mollie, different roles for
            admins/therapists/parents.

            In this team I worked as a Full Stack Developer, giving me a lot of

            At my internship for Rialto I created an iOS app from scratch in{
              " "
            }
            <b>Swift</b> where real estate companies could easily manage their listings.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            I created the screens in storyboards based on the designs provided
            by our designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the screens were finished I used Swift code to implement
            functionality such as logins through an API, fetching the listings
            through an API, saving the listings in the SQLite database..

            While working at Happs Development I also created a mobile
            application for a speech therapist to help children with discalculia
            to learn how to count and do simple math exercises in a fun game
            form.

          <p class="mb-4">
            The app was created from scratch using <b>React Native</b> for fast development,
            and Expo to get fast previews of the app on real devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me a lot about <b>animations</b>, how to handle
            dynamically generated sound output for the spoken numbers, learn
            which platform specific APIs to use..

            In my free time I like to experiment with other frameworks and
            technologies too, this is why I made a website using{" "}

            My friend gave me some high level designs, and I got to work! I
            selected a fitting theme.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built on the theme with a lot of plugins to optimize the speed of
            the website (Autoptimize), the SEO (Yoast) and anti-spam by Akismet.

            In 2020 I participated in <b>Hacktoberfest</b> for the first time ever.

            It was a lot of fun to coloborate with other <b>open source</b>{" "}

            For a family member of mine who started a psychotherapy practice, I
            created a website using Squarespace. I used a template and
            customized it to the needs of my friend, updated the copy and added
            some custom styling where needed. This was by far the easiest CMS
            I've ever worked with, and I'm very happy with the result.

            I like to use my personal website as a playground for new ideas and
            new technologies. The site used to be built in Next.js, but since
            I&apos;ve been using Next.js frequently at work, I wanted to try
            something new: Astro.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conversion of the project wasn&apos;t very hard, since I could
            easily copy over the JSX, since the Astro syntax is very close to
            it. The DX is unmatched, and it's so fast!. No Javascript loaded by
            default is a huge win for my site.
